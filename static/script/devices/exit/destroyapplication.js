/**
 * @fileOverview    Requirejs module containing the class for the destroyApplication exit strategy.
 *                  If following the OIPF spec, devices should do the same on a call to window.close()
 *                  as when using Application.destroyApplication, so this exit strategy is ONLY
 *                  necessary when a device does not follow the spec.
 *                  Otherwise, use the closewindow strategy. It's much simpler.
