/*
 * @fileOverview	Requirejs module containing the class for the destroyApplication exit strategy.
 * 					If following the OIPF spec, devices should do the same on a call to window.close()
 * 					as when using Application.destroyApplication, so this exit strategy is ONLY
 * 					necessary when a device does not follow the spec.
 * 					Otherwise, use the closewindow strategy. It's much simpler.
