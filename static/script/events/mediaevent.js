        MediaEvent.TYPES = [
            'loadstart',    // Event    The user agent begins looking for media data, as part of the resource selection algorithm.  networkState equals NETWORK_LOADING
            'progress',     // Event    The user agent is fetching media data.  networkState equals NETWORK_LOADING
            'suspend',  // Event    The user agent is intentionally not currently fetching media data, but does not have the entire media resource downloaded.  networkState equals NETWORK_IDLE
            'abort',        // Event    The user agent stops fetching the media data before it is completely downloaded, but not due to an error.   error is an object with the code MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED. networkState equals either NETWORK_EMPTY or NETWORK_IDLE, depending on when the download was aborted.
            // Handled separately: 'error',     // Event    An error occurs while fetching the media data.  error is an object with the code MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK or higher. networkState equals either NETWORK_EMPTY or NETWORK_IDLE, depending on when the download was aborted.
            'emptied',  // Event    A media element whose networkState was previously not in the NETWORK_EMPTY state has just switched to that state (either because of a fatal error during load that's about to be reported, or because the load() method was invoked while the resource selection algorithm was already running).    networkState is NETWORK_EMPTY; all the IDL attributes are in their initial states.
            'stalled',  // Event    The user agent is trying to fetch media data, but data is unexpectedly not forthcoming.     networkState is NETWORK_LOADING.
            'play',     // Event    Playback has begun. Fired after the play() method has returned, or when the autoplay attribute has caused playback to begin.    paused is newly false.
            'pause',        // Event    Playback has been paused. Fired after the pause() method has returned.  paused is newly true.
            'loadedmetadata',   // Event    The user agent has just determined the duration and dimensions of the media resource and the timed tracks are ready.    readyState is newly equal to HAVE_METADATA or greater for the first time.
            'loadeddata',   // Event    The user agent can render the media data at the current playback position for the first time.   readyState newly increased to HAVE_CURRENT_DATA or greater for the first time.
            'waiting',  // Event    Playback has stopped because the next frame is not available, but the user agent expects that frame to become available in due course.  readyState is newly equal to or less than HAVE_CURRENT_DATA, and paused is false. Either seeking is true, or the current playback position is not contained in any of the ranges in buffered. It is possible for playback to stop for two other reasons without paused being false, but those two reasons do not fire this event: maybe playback ended, or playback stopped due to errors.
            'playing',  // Event    Playback has started.   readyState is newly equal to or greater than HAVE_FUTURE_DATA, paused is false, seeking is false, or the current playback position is contained in one of the ranges in buffered.
            'canplay',  // Event    The user agent can resume playback of the media data, but estimates that if playback were to be started now, the media resource could not be rendered at the current playback rate up to its end without having to stop for further buffering of content.   readyState newly increased to HAVE_FUTURE_DATA or greater.
            'canplaythrough',   // Event    The user agent estimates that if playback were to be started now, the media resource could be rendered at the current playback rate all the way to its end without having to stop for further buffering.    readyState is newly equal to HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA.
            'seeking',  // Event    The seeking IDL attribute changed to true and the seek operation is taking long enough that the user agent has time to fire the event.
            'seeked',       // Event    The seeking IDL attribute changed to false.
            'timeupdate',   // Event    The current playback position changed as part of normal playback or in an especially interesting way, for example discontinuously.
            'ended',        // Event    Playback has stopped because the end of the media resource was reached.     currentTime equals the end of the media resource; ended is true.
            'ratechange',   // Event    Either the defaultPlaybackRate or the playbackRate attribute has just been updated.
            'durationchange',   // Event    The duration attribute has just been updated.
            'volumechange'  // Event    Either the volume attribute or the muted attribute has changed. Fired after the relevant attribute's setter has returned.
