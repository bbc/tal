*TAL* was developed internally within the BBC as a way of vastly simplifying TV application development
whilst increasing the reach of BBC TV applications such as *iPlayer*. Today all of the BBC's HTML-based
TV applications are built using *TAL*.

There are hundreds of different devices in the marketplace and they all use slightly different technologies
to achieve the same result. The purpose of TAL is to allow you to write an application once, and be confident
that it can be deployed to all HTML-based TV devices.
